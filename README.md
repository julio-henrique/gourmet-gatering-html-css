### Links
- Live Site URL: (https://julio-henrique.github.io/gourmet-gatering-html-css/)


## My process



### Built with
- HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned
This challenge was great to learn when and how to use the <div> tag, sometimes you want to separate two or more elements in the page, sometimes so that you can apply style, sometimes it's to separate only one element and ect. Like:
```html
<div>
  <a href="#home" class="home-link">Gourmet au Catering</a>
</div>
```

In CSS my biggest gain came on how to setup class names and how to use the cascading aspect of CSS to my advantage instead of my fall.
If I saw that some parts of the code were similar, like the title, then I would create one class and apply to everyone, avoiding repetition, DRY.

Still CSS - I also learned how to use *flexbox* 


### Continued development
I really liked this project :D, my continus growth will go with *flexbox*, after seeing how beatiful the project ended I'll continue in this *front-end* path!


### Useful resources
- [CSS resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This documentation really helped me. It was easy to read and follow, +1000 stars for them.
